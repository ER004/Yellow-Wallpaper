But, turn as fast as I can, I can only
see out of one at one time.
And though I always see her, she may
be able to creep faster than I can turn !
I have watched her sometimes away
off in the open country, creeping as fast
as a cloud shadow in a high wind.
* * * * * *
If only that top pattern could be gotten
off from the under one! I mean to
try it, little by little.
I have found out another funny thing,
but I shan't tell it this time! It does
not do to trust people too much.
There are only two more days to get
this paper off, and I believe John is
beginning to notice. I don't like the
look in his eyes.
And I heard him ask Jennie a lot of
professional questions about me. She
had a very good report to give.
She said I slept a good deal in the
daytime.
John 'knows I don't sleep very well at
night, for all I'm so quiet!
He asked me all sorts of questions, too,
and pretended to be very loving and
kind.
As if I couldn't see through him!
Still, I don't wonder he acts so, sleeping
under this paper for three months.
It only interests me, but I feel sure
John and Jennie are secretly affected by it.
* * * * * *
Hurrah! This is the last day, but it
is enough. John to stay in town over
night, and won't be out until this evening.
Jennie wanted to sleep with me - the
sly thing! but T told her I should undoubtedly
rest better for a night all
alone. .
That was clever, for really I wasn't
alone a bit! As soon as it was moonlight
and that poor thing began to crawl
and shake the pattern, I got up and ran
to help her.
I pulled and she shook, I shook and
she pulled, and before morning we had.
peeled off yards of that paper.
A strip about as high as my head and
half around the room.
And then when the sun came and that
awful pattern began to laugh at me, I declared
I would finish it to-dav !
We go away to-morrow, ~nd they are
moving all my furniture down again to
leave things as they were before.
Jennie looked at the wall in amazement,
but I told her merrily that I did it
out of pure spite at the vicious thing.
She laughed and said she wouldn't
mind doing it herself, but I must not get
tired.
How she betrayed herself that time!
But I am here, and no person touches
this paper but me,- not alive!
She tried to get me out of the roomit
was too patent! But I said it was so
quiet and empty and clean now that I believed
I would lie down again and sleep
all I could; and not to wake me even for
dinner - I would call when I woke.
So now she is gone, and the servants
are gone, and the things are gone, and
there is nothing left but that great bedstead
nailed down, with the canvas mattress
we found on it.
We shall sleep downstairs to-night, and
take the boat home to-morrow. .
I quite enjoy the room, now it is bare
again.
How those children did tear about
here!
This bedstead is fairly gnawed!
But I must get to work.
I have locked the door and thrown the
key down into the front path.
. I don't want to go out, and I don't
want to have anybody come in, till ] ohn
comes.
I want to astonish him.
I've got a rope up here that even J ennie
did not find. If that woman does
get out, and tries to get away, I can tie
her!
But I forgot I could not reach far without
anything to stand on !
This bed will not move!
I tried to lift and push it until I was
lame, and then I got so angry I bit off a
little piece at one corner - but it hurt
my teeth.
Then I peeled off all the paper I could
reach standing on the floor. It sticks
horribly and the pattern just enjoys it !
All those strangled heads and bulbous
eyes and waddling fungus growths just
shriek with derision i
I am getting angry enough to do something
desperate. To jump out of the

window would be admirable exercise, but
the bars are too strong even to try.
Besides I wouldn't do it. Of course
not. I know well enough that a step like
thJ.t is improper and might be miscon·
strued.
I don't like to look out of the windows
evell - there are so many of those creeping
women, and they creep so fast.
I wonder if they all come out of that
wall-p3.per as I did?
But I am securely fastened now by my
well-hidden rope - you don't get me out
in the road there !
I suppose I shall have to get back behind
the pattern when it comes night,
and that is hard!
It is so pleasant to be out in this great
room and creep around as I please!
I don't want to go outside. I won't,
even if Jennie asks me to.
For outside you have to creep on the
ground, and everything is green instead
of yellow.
But here I can creep smoothly on the
floor, and my shoulder just fits in that
long smooch around the wall, so I cannot
lose my way.
Why there's John at the door!
I t is no use, young man, you can't open it r
How he does call and pound!
Now he's crying for an axe.
It would be a shame to break dOWI1l
that beautiful door!
" John dear! " said I in the gentlest
voice, "the key is down by the front:
steps, under a plaintain leaf! "
That silenced him for a few moments_
Then he said - very quietly indeed.
" Open the door, my darling! "
" I can't," said 1. "The key is down
by the front door under a plantain leaf! ..
And then I said it again, several times.
very gently and slowly, and said it so
often that he had to go and see, and he
got it of course, and came in. He stopped
short by the door.
"What is the matter?" he cried. "For
God's sake, what are you doing! "
I kept on creeping just the same, but I
looked at him over my shoulder.
" I've got out at last," said I, " in spite
of you and Jane? And I've pulled off most
of the paper, so you can't put me back! "
Now why should that man have fainted?
But he did, and right across my path by
the wall, so that I had to creep over him
every time!
